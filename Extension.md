# EcoOptimizers - Sustainable Python Code Refactoring

EcoOptimizers is a VS Code extension that detects and refactors inefficient Python code, reducing unnecessary computations and lowering CO‚ÇÇ emissions. By identifying common code smells and providing automated refactoring suggestions, EcoOptimizers helps you write cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally friendly code.

## Features

- **Detect Code Smells** ‚Äì Automatically analyze your Python code to find inefficiencies.
- **Refactor Code Smells** ‚Äì Get instant suggestions and apply refactorings with ease.
- **Reduce CO‚ÇÇ Emissions** ‚Äì Improve computational efficiency and contribute to a greener future.
- **Seamless VS Code Integration** ‚Äì Analyze and optimize your code directly within the editor.

## Supported Code Smells

EcoOptimizers detects and refactors the following common code smells:

- **Cache Repeated Calls** ‚Äì Identifies functions that repeatedly compute the same result and suggests caching techniques.
- **Long Lambda Functions** ‚Äì Flags excessively long lambda expressions and converts them into named functions for readability and maintainability.
- **Use A Generator** ‚Äì Suggests using generators instead of list comprehensions for memory efficiency.
- **Long Element Chain** ‚Äì Detects deeply nested attribute accesses and recommends breaking them into intermediate variables for clarity.
- **Member Ignoring Method** ‚Äì Identifies methods that do not use their class members and suggests converting them into static methods or external functions.
- **Long Message Chains** ‚Äì Finds excessive method chaining and refactors them for better readability.
- **String Concatenation in Loop** ‚Äì Detects inefficient string concatenation inside loops and suggests using lists or other optimized methods.
- **Long Parameter List** ‚Äì Flags functions with too many parameters and suggests refactoring strategies such as grouping related parameters into objects.

## How It Works

1. **Detect Smells** ‚Äì Run the EcoOptimizers analysis tool to scan your code for inefficiencies.
2. **Refactor Suggestions** ‚Äì View recommended changes and apply them with a click.
3. **Optimize Your Code** ‚Äì Enjoy cleaner, more efficient Python code with reduced computational overhead.
