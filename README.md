### **Key Features**

1. **Refactoring Library**  
   - Provides automated refactoring tools aimed at optimising code for energy efficiency while preserving its functional behaviour.  
   - Analyses code to identify energy-intensive patterns and recommends or applies energy-saving transformations.  
   - Ensures refactored code remains maintainable and efficient across different platforms.

2. **Python-Specific Refactoring Optimization**  
   - Tailors energy-efficient refactoring strategies based on the specific characteristics of Python.  
   - Provides guidelines and transformations to minimise energy consumption while maintaining code compatibility.  
   - Adapts to the unique performance and energy model of Python.

3. **Library Plugin**  
   - Offers a plugin extension for popular IDEs and platforms, allowing developers to easily incorporate the refactoring library into their existing workflows.  
   - Provides real-time suggestions and refactoring options within the development environment, enhancing usability and accessibility.
