\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUserInterface}:] The user interface of the plugin. Enhancements may be required to improve usability or accommodate new features. Specific anticipated changes include:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Refactoring Suggestions Display}: Updates to how refactoring suggestions are presented, such as side-by-side views of original and refactored code.
          \item \textbf{Theme Support}: Adding compatibility with various VS Code themes, including light and dark modes.
          \item \textbf{Visual Indicators}: Implementing color-coded indicators to highlight the impact of energy savings for each refactoring suggestion.
          \item \textbf{Interactive Elements}: Introducing interactive components like tooltips or progress indicators to guide users during the refactoring process.
          \item \textbf{Customization Options}: Allowing users to configure UI elements, such as adjusting the sensitivity of code smell detection or selecting preferred refactoring styles.
      \end{itemize}
  
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acVSCodePlugin}:] The VS Code plugin's
    functionality. Future versions may expand to support more complex refactorings
    or additional code smells that users can address with minimal setup. Changes
    may involve adding more customizable user settings.
    
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acRefactorers}:] The refactorers responsible
    for detecting and fixing specific code smells. As more code smells are identified
    and refactoring techniques are developed, new modules may be added or existing
    ones may evolve. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Base Refactorer} \label{acBaseRefactorer}: Updates to the base refactorer module to
      support new refactoring patterns or improved algorithms.
      \item \textbf{Complex List Comprehension} \label{acComplexListComprehension}: Adding or modifying
      the logic for simplifying complex list comprehensions.
      \item \textbf{Long Element Chain} \label{acLongElementChain}: Refining the logic to handle longer
      chains of elements and optimize their readability and performance.
      \item \textbf{Long Lambda Function} \label{acLongLambdaFunction}: Improvements to better handle
      long lambda functions, making them more efficient and readable.
      \item \textbf{Long Message Chain} \label{acLongMessageChain}: Extending the module's ability
      to identify and refactor long message chains.
      \item \textbf{Member Ignoring Method} \label{acMemberIgnoringMethod}: Enhancements to the
      module for detecting methods that ignore members, optimizing the code structure.
      \item \textbf{Repeated Calls} \label{acRepeatedCalls}: Optimizing detection and handling
      of repeated function calls to improve performance.
      \item \textbf{String Concatenation in Loop} \label{acStringConcatenationInLoop}: Adjusting
      the refactorer's logic to improve handling of string concatenation within loops.
      \item \textbf{Long Parameter List} \label{acLongParameterList}: Future extensions to handle
      complex parameter lists in a more structured manner, perhaps allowing for simplifications.
    \end{itemize}
    
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSmell}:] The core logic
    for identifying specific code smells. As the system evolves, new code smells may be added to the system’s detection capabilities, necessitating changes to this module.
  
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAnalyzer}:] The analyzers used to
    gather metrics and assess code quality.
  
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acTesting}:] The testing module
    responsible for ensuring the correct functionality of the refactorers. As new
    features and code smells are added, this module may need updates to test these
    changes thoroughly.
\end{description}  

\wss{Anticipated changes relate to changes that would be made in requirements,
design or implementation choices.  They are not related to changes that are made
at run-time, like the values of parameters.}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPlatform}:] Transitioning from VS Code to another IDE. The plugin is tightly integrated with VS Code's API, making such a change complex.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucCoreLogic}:] Fundamental changes to the core logic of code smell detection. The current architecture is designed around widely accepted principles of software quality.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPluginType}:] Changing from a plugin-based architecture to a standalone application. This would require rethinking the entire deployment and user interaction model.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed

actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

\wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}
