\section{Introduction}

The following document details the Module Interface Specifications for
\wss{Fill in your project name and description}

Complementary documents include the System Requirement Specifications
and Module Guide.  The full documentation and implementation can be
found at \url{...}.  \wss{provide the url for your repo}

\section{Notation}

\wss{You should describe your notation.  You can use what is below as
  a starting point.}

The structure of the MIS for modules comes from \citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995},
with the addition that template modules have been adapted from
\cite{GhezziEtAl2003}.  The mathematical notation comes from Chapter 3 of
\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.  For instance, the symbol := is used for a
multiple assignment statement and conditional rules follow the form $(c_1
\Rightarrow r_1 | c_2 \Rightarrow r_2 | ... | c_n \Rightarrow r_n )$.

The following table summarizes the primitive data types used by \progname. 

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\noindent 
\begin{tabular}{l l p{7.5cm}} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ 
\midrule
character & char & a single symbol or digit\\
integer & $\mathbb{Z}$ & a number without a fractional component in (-$\infty$, $\infty$) \\
natural number & $\mathbb{N}$ & a number without a fractional component in [1, $\infty$) \\
real & $\mathbb{R}$ & any number in (-$\infty$, $\infty$)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\noindent
The specification of \progname \ uses some derived data types: sequences, strings, and
tuples. Sequences are lists filled with elements of the same data type. Strings
are sequences of characters. Tuples contain a list of values, potentially of
different types. In addition, \progname \ uses functions, which
are defined by the data types of their inputs and outputs. Local functions are
described by giving their type signature followed by their specification.

\section{Module Decomposition}

The following table is taken directly from the Module Guide document for this project.

\subsection{Semantics}

\subsubsection{State Variables}

\wss{Not all modules will have state variables.  State variables give the module
  a memory.}

\subsubsection{Environment Variables}

\wss{This section is not necessary for all modules.  Its purpose is to capture
  when the module has external interaction with the environment, such as for a
  device driver, screen interface, keyboard, file, etc.}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

\wss{Try to minimize assumptions and anticipate programmer errors via
  exceptions, but for practical purposes assumptions are sometimes appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Access Routine Semantics}

\noindent \wss{accessProg}():
\begin{itemize}
\item transition: \wss{if appropriate} 
\item output: \wss{if appropriate} 
\item exception: \wss{if appropriate} 
\end{itemize}

\wss{A module without environment variables or state variables is unlikely to
  have a state transition.  In this case a state transition can only occur if
  the module is changing the state of another module.}

\wss{Modules rarely have both a transition and an output.  In most cases you
  will have one or the other.}

\subsubsection{Local Functions}

\wss{As appropriate} \wss{These functions are for the purpose of specification.
  They are not necessarily something that is going to be implemented
  explicitly.  Even if they are implemented, they are not exported; they only
  have local scope.}

\section{MIS of LongElementChainRefactorer}

\subsection{Module}

LongElementChainRefactorer is a module that refactors long element chains, specifically focusing on flattening nested dictionaries to improve readability, maintainability, and energy efficiency. The module uses a recursive flattening strategy while caching previously seen patterns for optimization.

\section{MIS of Measurements Module}

\subsection{Module}

The MeasurementsModule is a module designed to measure and track the carbon emissions generated by executing Python scripts. By leveraging the CodeCarbon library, it allows developers to assess the environmental impact of their code execution. The module runs a specified Python file, tracks the associated carbon emissions during the execution, and logs the results for further analysis. It provides functionality for measuring, logging, and extracting emissions data in a structured manner to help improve energy efficiency in software development.

\subsection{Uses}

This module is used to monitor and track the carbon emissions of Python scripts, providing insights into the environmental impact of code execution. It is particularly useful for developers aiming to minimize the carbon footprint of their software projects and to incorporate energy-efficiency considerations into their development process.

\end{center}

\subsection{Semantics}

\subsubsection{State Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emissions\_data}: Stores the emissions data extracted from the CSV file generated by CodeCarbon. It is populated after the energy measurement process completes successfully. The value is either a dictionary containing the last row of emissions data or \texttt{None} if no data was extracted due to an error.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environment Variables}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{TEMP}: Sets the temporary directory location for Windows systems. Used during the CodeCarbon energy measurement process.
  \item \textbf{TMPDIR}: Sets the temporary directory location for Unix-based systems. Used during the CodeCarbon energy measurement process.
  \item \textbf{Logger}: A logging mechanism that logs various events during the energy measurement process, including errors, completion of measurements, and other key actions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The file at \texttt{file\_path} is a valid Python script.
  \item The CodeCarbon tool is properly installed and configured.

  \item \textbf{Output}: None.
  \item \textbf{Exception}: None.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\texttt{measure\_energy()}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Transition}:

      \item Creates a temporary directory to store custom data.
      \item Initializes the \texttt{EmissionsTracker} from CodeCarbon.
      \item Runs the script specified by \texttt{file\_path} and captures the output.
      \item Stops the tracker after execution and stores the emissions data.
      \item If available, it extracts the emissions data from the generated CSV file.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Output}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Logs the results of the energy measurement process.
        \item Stores the emissions data in \texttt{self.emissions\_data}.
    \end{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Exception}: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Logs an error if the file cannot be executed or if the emissions file is not created.
        \item If the emissions data cannot be extracted from the CSV file, logs the issue.
      \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Local Functions}
\paragraph{\texttt{\_extract\_emissions\_csv(csv\_file\_path: Path)}}
    
    Extracts emissions data from a CSV file generated by CodeCarbon.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Input}: \texttt{csv\_file\_path} - The path to the CSV file containing emissions data.
        \item \textbf{Output}: Returns the last row of emissions data as a dictionary, or \texttt{None} if an error occurs.
    \end{itemize}
