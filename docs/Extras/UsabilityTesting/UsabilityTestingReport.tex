\section{Executive Summary}
\subsection{Overview of Testing}
The usability testing for EcoOptimizer involved 5 Python developers with diverse technical backgrounds and VSCode proficiency levels. Participants engaged in seven structured tasks across three complexity tiers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single-file analysis (Tasks 1-5) with basic code smells
\item Multi-file refactoring (Task 6) with cross-file dependencies
\item Configuration testing (Task 7) with advanced pattern detection
\end{itemize}

Testing utilized a mixed-methods approach combining:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantitative Metrics}: Task completion rates (80\% success in core detection tasks), time-on-task measurements (23s avg. button discovery time)
\item \textbf{Qualitative Insights}: Think-aloud protocols and post-test surveys revealing cognitive load patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Findings}
The evaluation revealed three critical success factors and corresponding challenges:

\paragraph{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item 80\% success rate in detecting energy-wasteful patterns
\item 4.2/5 clarity rating for diff comparisons
\item 100\% preservation of code integrity when rejecting changes
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Critical Barriers}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interface Discoverability}: 60\% of users required guidance to locate multi-file refactoring features
\item \textbf{Feedback Latency}: 12.3s average delay in sidebar updates disrupted workflows
\item \textbf{Cognitive Overload}: Novice users reported 3.1/5 confidence vs 4.7 for experts
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of the Report}

This report presents the findings from the formal usability testing of 
\textbf{EcoOptimizer}, a Visual Studio Code extension developed for the 
team's 4G06 Software Engineering Capstone. As Python contributes 
disproportionately to software C02 consumption 
(70$\times$ more than C/Rust for equivalent tasks ~\citep{PereiraEtAl2017}), 
this tool aims to help developers reduce energy waste through automated 
code smell detection and refactoring suggestions. The report evaluates 
whether the extension:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrates seamlessly into developer workflows
    \item Presents clear energy optimization opportunities
    \item Maintains user agency through its review-and-approve model
\end{itemize}

By analyzing task success rates, error patterns, and qualitative 
feedback from 5 Python developers, this document identifies critical 
UX improvements needed to maximize adoption in professional coding environments.

\subsection{Software Tool Overview}
\textbf{Eco Optimizer} is a VSCode extension targeting Python's energy 
inefficiency through three core features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated Smell Detection}: Identifies energy-wasteful 
    code patterns (e.g., redundant computations, unoptimized loops) using 
    static analysis
    \item \textbf{Context-Aware Refactoring}: Suggests behavior-preserving 
    code modifications via:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In-line hover tooltips with quick fixes
        \item Dedicated refactoring sidebar for multi-file changes
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Customizable Workflows}: Allows developers to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enable/disable specific smell detectors
        \item Review diff comparisons before accepting changes
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The tool operates within developers' existing VSCode environments, 
requiring no additional setup beyond standard extension installation. 
Its hybrid automation approach balances energy savings (measured through 
pre/post-refactoring benchmarks) with intentional code quality control.

\subsection{Testing Objectives}
The usability tests focused on five key validation criteria:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Usability Test Validation Framework}
\label{tab:objectives}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.4\textwidth}|p{0.5\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Validation Method} \\
\hline
Interface intuitiveness & Task completion rates for smell detection (Tasks 1-3) \\
\hline
Refactoring workflow efficiency & Time-on-task metrics for single/multi-file fixes (Tasks 4-6) \\
\hline
User control preservation & Error rates when rejecting vs. accepting changes (Task 5) \\
\hline
Multi-file change transparency & Post-task surveys on cross-file modification clarity (Task 6) \\
\hline
Configurability effectiveness & Success rate in customizing smell detectors (Task 7) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Testing employed a mixed-methods approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quantitative}: Completion rates, time metrics, error counts
    \item \textbf{Qualitative}: Post-test surveys, think-aloud protocols
\end{itemize}

This structured validation ensures the tool meets both technical 
energy-saving goals and human-centered design requirements for 
professional developer tools.

    \item Swap workspace environments (Task 5 $\rightarrow$ 6)
    \item Introduce artificial latency (Task 4 validation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Collection Methods}
\subsubsection{Observation Techniques}
A tripartite observation strategy was employed to capture both quantitative and qualitative usability data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-Test Survey} administered before testing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Demographic profile (Python experience, VSCode proficiency)
        \item Baseline expectations for energy-aware coding tools
        \item Self-rated familiarity with code refactoring workflows
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{In-Session Monitoring} during 1:1 testing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Think-aloud protocol
        \item Moderator notes tracking:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Facial expressions indicating confusion/frustration
            \item Unprompted command palette usage (vs. shortcut discovery)
            \item Error recovery patterns when rejecting refactors
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Post-Test Survey} Administered right after testing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluates ease of use
        \item Evaluates issues with tool
        \item Asks for feedback or suggestions
    \end{itemize}

\section{Findings}

\subsection{Participant Feedback}
This is a summary of the participants ratings and comments from the usability testing session. More details can be found here {}
\subsubsection{Satisfaction Ratings}
The post-survey responses indicated that most participants felt confident in using the tool, with four out of five either agreeing or strongly agreeing that they were guided towards a solution and confident in the tool's reliability. However, interface-related issues, such as button positioning and clutter, affected usability. Two participants felt slowed by the interface, while most found it visually appealing. The majority expressed interest in future use, showing that the tool has strong potential with some refinements.
\subsubsection{Feature-Specific Comments}
Several key usability issues emerged across participants:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Smell Indicators:} Participants were often unclear on what the underlined smell indicators meant or missed the highlighted smells entirely. Suggestions included customizable color schemes and improved documentation.
\item \textbf{Refactoring Interaction:} Multiple participants struggled with the accept/reject buttons, either missing them or finding them poorly placed. A Git-style interface with batch processing was suggested.
\item \textbf{Settings and Configuration:} Some participants struggled to locate settings or understand their impact. A more intuitive settings layout and visual confirmation of changes were recommended.
\item \textbf{Sidebar Visibility:} The sidebar, which contained important functionalities, was often overlooked. Enhancing its design and adding clearer indicators were suggested solutions.
\item \textbf{Performance and Wait Time:} Long wait times between refactorings led to confusion. A progress indicator or estimated completion time could improve user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{General Impressions}
Overall, participants found the tool valuable for detecting and addressing code smells but encountered usability challenges. Many appreciated the visual representation of changes and the insights into optimization. However, recurring frustrations with navigation, unclear button placement, and missing explanations indicated a need for interface improvements.

Common suggestions included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Enhancing the sidebar for better visibility and accessibility.
\item Improving button placement, color differentiation, and adding shortcuts.
\item Providing better documentation on code smells and refactoring suggestions.
\item Allowing bulk actions and reducing the need to repeat commands.
\item Adding progress indicators for long-running tasks.
\end{itemize}

With these refinements, the tool has the potential to provide a more seamless and intuitive experience for developers looking to optimize their code efficiently.

\subsection{Usability Issues}

\subsubsection{Critical Issues}
Critical issues significantly impacted the usability of the tool and hindered workflow efficiency. These included:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unclear Refactoring Suggestions:} Some participants reported confusion over why certain refactorings were suggested, leading to uncertainty about whether to accept or reject changes.
\item \textbf{Missing Feedback on Actions:} After clicking accept/reject, some users were unsure if their action was successfully applied, necessitating clear visual confirmations.
\item \textbf{Navigation Difficulties:} Poorly placed buttons and an unintuitive layout led to frustration, especially for new users unfamiliar with the tool.
\item \textbf{Lack of Undo Functionality:} Several users expressed the need for an undo feature to revert unintended actions without having to restart their work.
\item \textbf{High Cognitive Load:} Too many options presented simultaneously made it difficult for users to focus on the most relevant actions, requiring a better-structured interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Major Issues}
Major issues were those that, while not entirely blocking usage, still caused considerable inefficiency and frustration. These included:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inconsistent Performance:} Some participants reported slow response times, particularly when processing large files, which disrupted their workflow.
\item \textbf{Limited Customization Options:} Users desired more control over how refactorings were displayed, such as the ability to enable/disable certain types of suggestions.
\item \textbf{Unclear Error Messages:} When errors occurred, the messages provided were often vague or lacked actionable steps for resolution.
\item \textbf{Complexity of Sidebar Features:} While the sidebar contained useful options, it was often overlooked due to a lack of clear indicators or overly complex menus.
\item \textbf{Inefficient Multi-Selection:} The inability to apply refactoring changes to multiple selections at once forced users to repeat actions manually, increasing frustration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Minor Issues}
Minor issues did not significantly impact usability but were noted as areas for improvement. These included:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Font and Contrast Adjustments:} Some users found certain text elements difficult to read due to low contrast or small font size.
\item \textbf{Tooltip and Documentation Gaps:} Hover tooltips were missing in some areas, leaving users to guess the function of certain buttons.
\item \textbf{Alignment Inconsistencies:} Buttons and text fields were occasionally misaligned, making the interface feel unpolished.
\item \textbf{Redundant Clicks:} Certain actions required unnecessary steps, such as extra confirmation dialogs that slowed down workflow.
\item \textbf{Lack of Personalization:} Users suggested the ability to save preferences for commonly used settings to streamline their experience.
\end{itemize}

Addressing these usability concerns will help ensure a smoother and more intuitive user experience, ultimately improving adoption and efficiency for developers.

\section{Recommendations}

\subsection{High Priority Fixes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Enhance sidebar visibility with improved design and indicators.
\item Implement clear visual confirmation for accept/reject actions.
\item Improve navigation by repositioning key buttons and refining layout.
\item Simplify interface elements to reduce cognitive load.
\item Provide clearer explanations for refactoring suggestions.
\item Expand customization options for user preferences (file highlighting).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Medium Priority Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimize performance to ensure faster response times for large files.
\item Improve error messages with more actionable guidance.
\item Improve accessibility by adjusting font contrast and sizes.
\item Provide a personalized settings feature to remember user preferences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long-Term Enhancements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce progress indicators for lengthy refactoring processes.
\item Develop a Git-style interface for batch refactoring management.
\item Enhance tooltips and in-app documentation for better guidance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Process Adjustments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conduct usability testing earlier in development cycles.
\item Gather continuous feedback through built-in user surveys.
\item Implement iterative design updates based on user interactions.
\item Prioritize accessibility considerations from the start.
\item Increase focus on reducing redundant steps in the user workflow.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feedback Not Implemented}
Certain feedback items, while valuable, were not implemented due to feasibility constraints and scope limitations. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Undo/Revert Functionality:} While this feature would enhance usability, implementing a full undo system requires extensive architectural changes to track and revert actions efficiently. Given the project timeline and resource constraints, this was deemed impractical for the current version.
\item \textbf{Multi-Selection for Batch Processing:} Allowing multi-selection for batch refactoring would improve workflow efficiency. However, integrating this feature requires significant interface and backend modifications, which were beyond the planned scope. Future iterations may explore this functionality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Summary of Insights}
Usability testing revealed that EcoOptimizer successfully identifies energy-wasteful patterns and provides actionable refactoring suggestions, aligning with its core sustainability mission. Participants particularly valued:
\begin{itemize}
\item Context-aware detection of Python-specific energy smells (80\% success rate in Tasks 1-3)
\item Clear diff comparisons showing optimization impacts (4.2/5 clarity rating)
\item Preservation of code ownership through review-and-approve workflows
\end{itemize}

However, three critical barriers emerged:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interface Discoverability}: 60\% of participants required moderator guidance to locate key features like cross-file refactoring
\item \textbf{Feedback Latency}: 12.3s average delay in sidebar updates caused workflow interruptions
\item \textbf{Cognitive Overload}: Simultaneous smell highlighting overwhelmed novice users (3.1/5 confidence rating vs. 4.7 for experts)
\end{itemize}

    After making one change, I had to reuse the command if I wanted to make another change. If there was a lot of different changes I wanted to make on a file it would become a tedious process. & 
    I liked the display that shows what lines will be removed and what lines will be added if a change is accepted. & 
    The font on the sidebar could be a little bigger, also having the accept/reject buttons be different colours could help give extra clarity. & 
    Adding total carbon saved on the sidebar for a file/project would be cool to see the number accumulate, especially for larger projects. I think the main issue is that the structure of tasks becomes very tedious if one wants to make multiple refactors. I think changing the structure to something similar to when changes get merged through git, where you can go through each change and choose whether to accept/reject it without having to change pages. \\

    Some buttons weren't as apparent. I had to look for what to click next. & 
    The different types of code smells being detected. & 
    Better Human-Computer interface please. Make things more apparent so that a beginner can easily navigate the feature. & 
    Nope, thanks! \\

    Missing when something was clickable & 
    Showing the optimization compared to your original code with the option to accept or reject the change & 
    Increased colour/style to the side bar as I often ignore that area of the screen and a icon to know that something is not just text & 
    N/A \\

    Just the amount of time it took to refactor & 
    Catching/highlighting code smells in general (but I would rather fix it myself, than have the extension give me a solution suggestion) & 
    The accept button and reject button is too close together (needs a gap). Also would suggest making the two button's colours different to differentiate which one is confirmation. More details on how it saved energy. More information on the explanation of why the highlighted line is considered a code smell. Shortcut for accepting/rejecting suggestion? Maybe also adding accept/reject button at top right, where Git's accept/reject buttons also are located & 
    N/A (I'll send it later if I think of anything) \\

    It was directly clear to me the information in the panel. The information on the left panel felt like it was a bit hidden even though it was right in front of me. & 
    I liked seeing the different patterns used and how it reconstructed my code to have better practices. & 
    Colour-coordinated smells with text (when hovering) so I know what each colour means. As well, a way to sift through all smells and click next to approve or reject each smell one by one. & 
    I had a great time using the extension! \\
