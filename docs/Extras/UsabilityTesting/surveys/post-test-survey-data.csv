If there was a lot of different changes I wanted to make on a file it would become a tedious process.",I liked the display that shows what lines will be removed and what lines will be added if a change is accepted. ,"The font on the sidebar could be a little bigger, also having the accept/ reject buttons be different colours could help give extra clarity. ","Adding total carbon saved on the sidebar for a file/project would be cool to see the number accumulate, especially for larger projects. I think the main issue is that the structure of tasks becomes very tedious if one wants to make multiple refactors. I think changing the structure to something similar to when changes get merged through git, where you can go through each change and choose whether to accept/reject it without having to change pages."

I had to look for what to click next.,The different types of code smells being detected.,Better Human-Computer interface please. Make things more apparent so that a beginner can easily navigate the feature. ,"Nope, thanks!"

Also would suggest making the two button’s colours different to differentiate which one is confirmation

More details on how it saved energy

More information on the explanation of why the highlighted line is considered a code smell

Shortcut for accepting/rejecting suggestion? Maybe also adding accept/reject button at top right, where Git’s accept/rehect buttons also are located",N/A (i’ll send it later if I think of anything)

The information on the left panel felt like it was a bit hidden even though it was right in front of me.,I liked seeing the different patterns used and how it reconstructed my code to have better practices.,"Colour-coordinated smells with text (when hovering) so I know what each colour means.

As well, a way to sift through all smells and click next to approve or reject each smell one by one.",I had a great time using the extension!
