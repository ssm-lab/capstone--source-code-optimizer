3/5/2025 17:13:25,"South Asian (e.g., Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi)",4th Year Student,A few times a week,Intermediate,Occasionally (only when necessary),No,,No,5,I hope this extension makes my computer not die in terms of energy consumption. I hope it points out bad patterns in my code in terms of too many same for loops and repeated code.
