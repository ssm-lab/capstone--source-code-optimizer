\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

For our proof of concept demonstration, we will showcase the core functionality of our energy-efficient 
Python code refactoring tool. The demonstration will focus on the following key aspects:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Code Smell Detection:} We will show how we used Pylint to identify inefficient code 
    patterns (code smells) in Python source code that may lead to higher energy consumption.
    \item \textbf{Refactoring:} Using the Rope library, we'll demonstrate how our tool will 
    apply refactorings to address the detected code smells.
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption Measurement:} We will show how we utilized CodeCarbon to measure 
    and compare the energy consumption of the original code versus the refactored version.
    \item \textbf{Functionality Preservation:} We will demonstrate that the refactored code 
    maintains its original functionality by running the original test suite against both versions of the code.
    \item \textbf{Performance Metrics:} We will display performance reports comparing the original and refactored 
    code, highlighting improvements in energy efficiency.
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 11\\
Sevhena Walker & 11\\
NIvetha Kuruparan & 11\\
Tanveer Brar & 11\\
Mya Hussain & 11\\
Ayushi Amin & 11\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We aim to have all team members present for any team meetings we hold. If one person cannot attend the meeting, we usually reschedule to a different time.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 4\\
Sevhena Walker & 4\\
NIvetha Kuruparan & 4\\
Tanveer Brar & 4\\
Mya Hussain & 4\\
Ayushi Amin & 4\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We aim to have all team members present for any meetings we have with our supervisor. If one person cannot attend the meeting, we usually reschedule to a different time.

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 12\\
Sevhena Walker & 11\\
NIvetha Kuruparan & 8\\
Tanveer Brar & 8\\
Mya Hussain & 6\\
Ayushi Amin & 6\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We aim to have at least one team member present for lectures to make sure we don't miss any critical information regarding deliverables.

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Sevhena Walker & 3\\
NIvetha Kuruparan & 3\\
Tanveer Brar & 3\\
Mya Hussain & 3\\
Ayushi Amin & 3\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Commits}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 396 & 100\% \\
Ayushi Amin & 89 & 23\% \\
Tanveer Brar & 44 & 11\% \\
Mya Hussain & 59 & 15\% \\
Sevhena Walker & 156 & 39\% \\
Nivetha Kuruparan & 48 & 12\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Some people might have higher commit counts because they commit more frequently or make smaller, more granular changes, whereas others might commit less often with larger, consolidated changes. Additionally some group members squash and merge when merging PRs and others forget sometimes.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Sevhena Walker & 25 & 24 \\
Mya Hussain & 10 & 19 \\
Nivetha Kurparan & 18 & 23 \\
Tanveer Brar & 9 & 20 \\
Ayushi Amin & 12 & 21 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The numbers in the \textbf{Assigned} column give a better picture of each team members contribution. Many commits were sometimes authored by the same person due to differences in team responsibilities (logistics and management). Furthermore, the issues here refer to what we can call ``work'' issues. Issues with the \texttt{lecture}, \texttt{team-meeting}, \texttt{sup-meeting}, and \texttt{ta-meeting} labels are not included in this tally.
