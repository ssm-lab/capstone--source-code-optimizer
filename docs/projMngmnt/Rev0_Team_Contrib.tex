\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the POC demo and the Rev
0 demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\wss{What will you be demonstrating}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

Our team stays in touch regularly through Discord and schedules a meeting when detailed discussion is needed. Below is the attendance of all format meetings that have taken place.

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Sevhena Walker & 3\\
Mya Hussain & 3\\
Ayushi Amin & 3\\
Nivetha Kuruparan & 3\\
Tanveer Brar & 3\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

We prioritize having in person meetings with our supervisor Dr David to be able to effectively communicate our progress and concerns. We have a weekly slot open with the supervisor, but in case there is little to discuss, the meeting is cancelled for the week and our progress is communicated via Discord.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 4\\
Sevhena Walker & 4\\
Mya Hussain & 4\\
Ayushi Amin & 4\\
Nivetha Kuruparan & 4\\
Tanveer Brar & 4\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

We aim to have at least one person attend the lecture so the team is upto date with all information. In the rare case that no one goes to the lecture, we update through the lecture slides. 

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of
lectures since the beginning of the term.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 2\\
Sevhena Walker & 1\\
Mya Hussain & 0\\
Ayushi Amin & 0\\
Nivetha Kuruparan & 0\\
Tanveer Brar & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{lll}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}
