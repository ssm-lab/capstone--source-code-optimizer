\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, an essential component of the global economy, is responsible for 2-4\% of global CO2 emissions today, with projections suggesting this could rise to 14\% by 2040 ~\citep{BelkhirAndElmeligi2018}. To meet sustainability goals, including a 72\% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}, this sector must find ways to improve energy efficiency.

One area of concern is the energy consumption of software systems. However, for software engineers, it is not practical for them to focus on optimizing energy consumption while developing complex programs. Instead, supporting tools and technologies are needed to assist in improving energy efficiency without altering the intended behaviour of the software.

This project aims to tackle Python, a popular but energy inefficient programming language. Python consumes significantly more energy compared to more efficient languages like C and Rust—over 70 times more energy, on average, for similar tasks ~\citep{PereiraEtAl2017}. The project's goal is to develop tools to reduce Python's energy consumption through automated refactoring. While this will not solve the entire problem of the carbon footprint associated with the software, it is a step towards more energy-efficient practices in the software development process.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\noindent \textbf{Purpose}: The purpose of this project is to provide software engineers with tools to optimize the energy efficiency of Python programs by automating refactoring suggestions, while still allowing users to review and decide whether or not to apply the changes.

\noindent \textbf{Advantage}: By reducing the energy consumption of Python programs, this project will contribute to the broader effort of decreasing the carbon footprint of software development, supporting the ICT sector's goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 72\% by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}.

\noindent \textbf{Measurement}: The project's success can be measured by the reduction in energy usage 
achieved after applying the refactorings. Benchmarks will compare the energy consumption of original 
and refactored code, to achieve a measurable percentage reduction in energy consumption. The user's 
ability to make informed choices about whether to apply refactorings will also be evaluated through 
user feedback.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

  The current software development landscape often prioritizes functionality and performance over energy efficiency. Many existing Python codebases are not optimized for energy consumption, leading to unnecessary power usage and increased carbon footprint. The following aspects characterize the current situation:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Manual Refactoring:} Developers typically perform refactoring manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
    \item \textbf{Limited Awareness:} Many developers lack awareness of energy-efficient coding practices and their impact on overall energy consumption.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Automated Tools:} There is a lack of widely adopted automated tools specifically designed to refactor Python code for energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Performance-Centric Optimization:} Most existing optimization tools focus on performance improvements rather than energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Code Patterns:} Many codebases contain inefficient code patterns that consume more energy than necessary.
  \end{enumerate}

  The project aims to address these issues by:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated Refactoring Library:} Developing a Python library that automatically detects and refactors code for improved energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{IDE Integration:} Creating a Visual Studio Code plugin that integrates the refactoring library, providing real-time suggestions and automated refactoring options.
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption Measurement:} Implementing tools to measure and compare energy consumption before and after refactoring.
    \item \textbf{Developer Education:} Raising awareness about energy-efficient coding practices through the tool's suggestions and documentation.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:} Implementing a reinforcement learning model to improve refactoring suggestions over time based on developer feedback and real-world energy savings data.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[label=FR \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
    \item \emph{The system must accept Python source code files.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The system needs to process Python code as its primary input to refactor and improve energy efficiency.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system successfully processes valid Python files without errors and provides feedback for invalid files.
    \item \emph{The system must identify specific code smells that can be targeted for energy saving.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Energy inefficiencies are often related to well-known code smells, so identifying them is the first step in improving efficiency.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool should detect and report at least 80\% of the following code smells: Large Class (LC), Long Parameter List (LPL), Long Method (LM), Long Message Chain (LMC), Long Scope Chaining (LSC), Long Base Class List (LBCL), Useless Exception Handling (UEH), Long Lambda Function (LLF), Complex List Comprehension (CLC), Long Element Chain (LEC), Long Ternary Conditional Expression (LTCE).
    \item \emph{The system must suggest at least one appropriate refactoring for each detected code smell to decrease energy consumption or indicate that none can be found.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} For developers to optimize their code, the tool must provide appropriate refactoring suggestions based on detected code smells.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The suggested refactored code demonstrates a measurable improvement in energy consumption as measured in joules.
    \item \emph{The tool must implement an algorithm to choose the most optimal refactoring based on measured energy consumption.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} There may be multiple ways to refactor code, but the most energy-efficient one should be chosen.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The algorithm evaluates multiple refactoring options and selects the one that results in the lowest energy consumption for the given code smell.
    \item \emph{The system must produce valid refactored Python code as output or indicate that no possible refactorings were found.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Refactored code must remain functional and error-free to ensure maintainability and usability.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The output code is syntactically correct and adheres to Python standards, validated by an automatic linter.
    \item \emph{The system must allow users to input their original test suite as a required argument.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Verifying that the refactored code preserves functionality requires the use of the original test suite.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users can specify a path to their test suite that the tool recognizes and utilizes for testing the refactored code.
    \item \emph{The system shall maintain the original functionality of the Python code after refactoring.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Ensuring that the refactored code preserves the original behaviour is critical to avoid regressions or unexpected issues in the software.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system runs the original test suite against the refactored code and passes 100\% of the tests.
    \item \emph{The tool must be compatible with various Python versions and common libraries.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The tool should be flexible enough to be used across different Python environments.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool operates correctly with the latest two major versions of Python (e.g., Python 3.8 and 3.9) and commonly used libraries.
    \item \emph{The tool must generate comprehensive reports on detected smells, refactorings applied, energy consumption measurements, and testing results.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers need clear reports to understand the impact of the refactorings and to track changes effectively.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Reports are clear, well-structured, and provide actionable insights, allowing users to easily understand the results.
    \item \emph{The tool must provide comprehensive documentation and help resources.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Detailed documentation is necessary to help users install, understand, and use the tool effectively.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Documentation covers installation, usage, and troubleshooting, receiving positive feedback for clarity and completeness from users.
    \item \emph{The system shall provide developers with refactoring suggestions within an IDE before committing code, allowing them to review and approve energy-efficient changes.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Giving developers control over which refactorings are applied ensures that they can maintain the balance between energy efficiency and their coding style or project requirements.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The IDE plugin must display at least two refactoring options for inefficient code patterns, allowing developers to either apply or reject them before committing the changes.
    \item \emph{The system shall integrate with GitHub and provide an automated refactoring process that is triggered when code is pushed to a repository.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Automated refactoring integrated into CI/CD pipelines ensures that energy-efficient code is maintained across all stages of development, reducing the burden on developers.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The refactoring process must be triggered automatically on GitHub commits, with at least 95\% of refactorings improving energy efficiency without introducing any functional errors.
    \item \emph{The system shall allow developers to undo any refactorings applied, restoring the code to its previous state.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers may want to revert changes if they do not align with specific project goals or introduce performance bottlenecks unrelated to energy consumption.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system must provide an option to revert any refactoring applied within the last 5 commits, restoring both code and energy consumption metrics to their original state.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Look and Feel Requirements}
\subsection{Appearance Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[label=LFR-AP \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
    \item \emph{The IDE plugin refactoring interface shall present the original and refactored code side by side, allowing developers to compare and choose between them easily.}\\[2mm]

\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The introduction of the energy efficiency refactoring tool may lead to several changes in the current development environment. These effects include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool temporarily increases CPU and memory usage while running. The tool aims to optimize energy efficiency in code however it takes energy to run - in large codebases this could be significant energy and impact the performance of other applications running concurrently. 
  \item The tool may have its own dependencies that now need to be included in the app or installed into the current system. Think Pysmells, Pyjoule etc.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Existing systems may need to be evaluated for compatibility with the new tool. Older versions of Python or other needed dependencies may not support the tool.
  \item The refactoring process could lead to variations in the performance of existing applications
  \item As the tool updates existing code, thorough testing will be needed to ensure everything still works correctly. This may require more effort from QA teams and additional time and resources to check the updated code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users may face difficulties in understanding how to effectively utilize the tool, particularly if they are not familiar with concepts like code smells and refactoring techniques. This learning curve may lead to initial frustration or reduced productivity.
  \item Some users may be resistant to adopting new tools or processes, particularly if they perceive the existing workflows as sufficient. This resistance could hinder the tool's successful implementation and limit its overall effectiveness.
  \item Users may misinterpret the output reports generated by the tool, such as energy savings or performance metrics. If users do not fully understand how to interpret these results, it could lead to incorrect conclusions about the tool's impact on their code.
  \item There is a risk that users might become overly reliant on the tool for refactoring without fully understanding the underlying principles. This could result in poor coding practices if users do not engage in thoughtful analysis of the suggested changes.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Limited Computational Resources:} Environments with restricted computational power may face challenges when running the tool, especially for large codebases. Limited resources could result in longer processing times or failures during analysis and refactoring.
  \item \textbf{Lack of Test Coverage:} If existing codebases lack comprehensive test suites, validating the functionality of refactored code may become challenging. Without adequate tests, it will be difficult to ensure that the tool's changes do not introduce new issues.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Ongoing Maintenance:} The tool will need regular updates to stay compatible with new programming languages or standards, adding to the workload.
  \item \textbf{Performance Trade-offs:} Users may find that while some refactorings improve energy efficiency, they could negatively impact other performance metrics, such as execution speed.

\section{Costs}
The total cost of developing this project is primarily based on the effort involved by the development team, given that the tools and platforms used (GitHub, open-source libraries) are free. The project must be completed within the academic year (MVP ready by February 2025), which warrants smart planning and efficient resource allocation.

\subsection{Metrics for Estimation}
To estimate the total cost in terms of time and effort, the following key metrics have been considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of input/output flows for the system.
    \item Number of business events.
    \item Number of product use cases.
    \item Number of functional and non-functional requirements.
    \item Number of constraint requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimation Approach}
Each deliverable has been assessed to estimate the time it will take to implement based on the development environment. Early cost estimates are based on general knowledge of the system and refined as the team gradually gets a better understanding of the scope.

\subsection{Cost Breakdown}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development Effort:} Based on the team size and project timeline, following time allocation is estimated:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Initial Research \& Setup: 50 hours per team member.
            \item Core development (e.g., refactoring tool, plugin): 300 hours per team member.
            \item Testing and debugging: 80 hours per team member.
            \item Documentation \& finalization: 100 hours per team member.
            \item \textbf{Total estimated effort:} 530 hours per team member.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Tools and Software:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GitHub (for CI/CD): Free account, with no cost expected.
        \item Open-source libraries (PySmells, PyJoules): No associated costs.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Testing Environment:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The testing of the refactoring tool and energy consumption measurements is planned to be carried out using free tools on open source projects, with no additional cost expected.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimated Cost}
The above discussion indicates that the total effort will be approximately 2650 team hours spread across the project phases. These estimates could be refined using more detailed information as the project progresses.

\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{enumerate}[label=WTRM \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
	\item \emph{The IDE plugin must provide interactive tips and progress indicators to guide users during the refactoring process.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This helps prevent user confusion during the refactoring process and enhances the user experience by providing clear, real-time feedback.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Tips and progress indicators display automatically when users initiate a refactoring action in the VSCode interface.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The tool must provide automated error reporting with user consent.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Automated error reporting helps developers quickly identify and address issues, improving the tool's reliability and reducing downtime with an option to include additional comments for context.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users are prompted to send error reports when an issue occurs, \\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The tool must allow users to define custom refactoring rules or preferences within the plugin.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This would allow developers more flexibility and control, enabling them to apply refactorings that best suit their projects while maintaining energy efficiency.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users can create a configuration file that describes their refactoring preferences.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The tool should provide a dashboard that offers deeper insights into refactoring decisions, showing side-by-side comparisons of energy consumption before and after refactoring, along with performance metrics.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This would help users better understand the impact of refactoring on both energy consumption and performance.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users are able to access energy metrics for all their projects on a centralized platform.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The tool show provide a plugin that integrates with multiple popular IDEs and syncs information across them through a centralized database.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Supporting multiple IDEs allows developes to use the tool within their preferred coding environments, enhancing user experience and adoption.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Integration guides are provided for each supported IDE, with successful installation and functionality confirmed through user testing.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Low
  \item \emph{The refactoring library must be able to provide energy efficient refactorings for a wide variety of program languages (e.g., Java, C/C++, C\#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Users around the world code projects in multitudes of languages depending on the context of their work. Being able to refactor in most popular languages would allow for the widespread usage of the tool.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool tailors accepts and tailors code from the detected/specified language.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Low
  \item \emph{The reinforcement learning model for the tool should accept human feedback in the reinforcement learning process.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This will allow users to guide the system's refactoring decisions based on developer expertise and preferences. Moreover, it will balance automated refactoring with human oversight to ensure that complex refactoring decisions align with the project's goals and constraints.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The language model accepts human feedback and incorporates it into its future decisions.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
