\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, an
essential component of the global economy, is responsible for 2-4\%
of global CO2 emissions today, with projections suggesting this could
rise to 14\% by 2040 ~\citep{BelkhirAndElmeligi2018}. To meet
sustainability goals, including a 72\% reduction in CO2 emissions by
2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}, this sector must find ways to
improve energy efficiency.

One area of concern is the energy consumption of software systems.
However, for software engineers, it is not practical for them to
focus on optimizing energy consumption while developing complex
programs. Instead, supporting tools and technologies are needed to
assist in improving energy efficiency without altering the intended
behaviour of the software.

This project aims to tackle Python, a popular but energy inefficient
programming language. Python consumes significantly more energy
compared to more efficient languages like C and Rust—over 70 times
more energy, on average, for similar tasks ~\citep{PereiraEtAl2017}.
The project's goal is to develop tools to reduce Python's energy
consumption through automated refactoring. While this will not solve
the entire problem of the carbon footprint associated with the
software, it is a step towards more energy-efficient practices in the
software development process.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\noindent \textbf{Purpose}: The purpose of this project is to provide
software engineers with tools to optimize the energy efficiency of
Python programs by automating refactoring suggestions, while still
allowing users to review and decide whether to apply the changes.

\noindent \textbf{Advantage}: By reducing the energy consumption of
Python programs, this project will contribute to the broader effort
of decreasing the carbon footprint of software development,
supporting the ICT sector's goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 72\% by
2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}.

\noindent \textbf{Measurement}: The project's success can be measured
by the reduction in energy usage
achieved after applying the refactorings. Benchmarks will compare the
energy consumption of original
and refactored code, to achieve a measurable percentage reduction in
energy consumption.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed for this system that users will be seeking to refactor
Python code and will make use of Visual Studio Code.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
This section defines the boundaries and objectives of the work,
focusing on the tasks and components required to develop and deliver
the refactoring library. It provides a clear view of how the system
operates within its context and breaks the work into logical
partitions to facilitate development and implementation.

\subsection{The Current Situation}

The current software development landscape often prioritizes
functionality and performance over energy efficiency. Many existing
Python codebases are not optimized for energy consumption, leading to
unnecessary power usage and increased carbon footprint. The following
aspects characterize the current situation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Manual Refactoring:} Developers typically perform
    refactoring manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
  \item \textbf{Limited Awareness:} Many developers lack awareness of
    energy-efficient coding practices and their impact on overall
    energy consumption.
  \item \textbf{Absence of Automated Tools:} There is a lack of
    widely adopted automated tools specifically designed to refactor
    Python code for energy efficiency.
  \item \textbf{Performance-Centric Optimization:} Most existing
    optimization tools focus on performance improvements rather than
    energy efficiency.
  \item \textbf{Inefficient Code Patterns:} Many codebases contain
    inefficient code patterns that consume more energy than necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{red}{The project aims to address these issues by:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Automated Refactoring Library:} Developing a Python
    library that automatically detects and refactors code for
    improved energy efficiency.
  \item \textbf{IDE Integration:} Creating a Visual Studio Code
    plugin that integrates the refactoring library, providing
    real-time suggestions and automated refactoring options.
  \item \textbf{Energy Consumption Measurement:} Implementing tools
    to measure and compare energy consumption before and after refactoring.
  \item \textbf{Developer Education:} Raising awareness about
    energy-efficient coding practices through the tool's suggestions
    and documentation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The purpose of this subsection is to illustrate the flow of inputs,
outputs, and interactions between the refactoring library and its
external systems, such as developers and energy measurement tools.
\hyperref[img:work-context]{Figure 1} highlights the connections between 
the system's components and external elements, ensuring a comprehensive 
understanding of its operational environment.

    \textbf{Input:} Python Code \\
    \textbf{Output:} Refactored Code \\
    \textbf{Pre-condition:} User uses the VS Code plugin to submit python code to the 
    refactoring tool \\[2mm]
    \textbf{Scenario:}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
      \item Refactoring tool receives the Python code
      \item Code Carbon is used to store energy consumption data for the
        original Python code submitted

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[label=FR \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The system must accept Python source code files.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The system needs to process Python code as its
    primary input to refactor and improve energy efficiency.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system successfully processes valid
    Python files without errors and provides feedback for invalid files.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The system must identify specific code smells that can
    be targeted for energy saving.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Energy inefficiencies are often related to
    well-known code smells, so identifying them is the first step in
    improving efficiency.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool should be meet the SMELL\_COVERAGE
    for the detection and reporting of the following smells: Long
    Parameter List (LPL), Long Message Chain (LMC), Long Element
    Chain (LEC), Long Lambda Function (LLF), Complex List
    Comprehension (CLC), Member Ignoring Method (MIM), Cache Repeated Calls (CRC),
    String Concat in Loop (SCL).\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The system must suggest at least one appropriate
      refactoring for each detected code smell to decrease energy
    consumption or indicate that none can be found.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} For developers to optimize their code, the tool
    must provide an appropriate refactoring suggestion based on
    detected code smells.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The suggested refactored code demonstrates a
    measurable improvement in energy consumption as measured in kg.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The system must produce valid refactored Python code as
    output or indicate that no possible refactorings were found.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Refactored code must remain functional and
    error-free to ensure maintainability and usability.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The output code is syntactically correct and
    adheres to Python standards, validated by an automatic linter.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The tool must require Python version 3.10 to run but
      must be capable of analyzing and refactoring Python code written
    for versions 3.8 and newer.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The tool leverages features available in Python
    3.10 for its operation while ensuring compatibility with
    analyzing codebases written in Python 3.8 and 3.9, which are the
    most widely adopted recent major versions in use.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool operates correctly in a Python 3.10
    environment and successfully analyzes and refactors code written
    for Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and newer.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The system must generate and display energy consumption metrics.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers need clear metrics as a justification for energy efficient refactorings.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Energy consumption metrics are clear, well-structured, and
    provide actionable insights, allowing users to easily understand the results.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The tool must provide comprehensive documentation and
    help resources.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Detailed documentation is necessary to help
    users install, understand, and use the tool effectively.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Documentation covers installation, usage,
    and troubleshooting, receiving positive feedback for clarity and
    completeness from users.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The system shall provide developers with refactoring
      suggestions within an IDE before changing code, allowing them
    to review and approve energy-efficient changes.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Giving developers control over which
    refactorings are applied ensures that they can maintain the
    balance between energy efficiency and their coding style or
    project requirements.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The IDE plugin must display refactoring options for inefficient 
    code patterns if possible, allowing developers to either apply or reject them before making any changes. \\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The system must allow users to filter detected code smells within the IDE plugin.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers should be able to focus on specific types of inefficiencies based on their 
    project needs and priorities.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The plugin provides a user-friendly interface that enables filtering detected code 
    smells by category, severity, or type, ensuring a customized refactoring experience.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The system should indicate code smells within a smell-linted file.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers need a clear visual representation of detected code smells to efficiently identify problematic areas in their code.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system highlights detected code smells within the source file, for example, by underlining or marking affected lines.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  
  \item \emph{The system should allow users to configure how code smells are displayed within a smell-linted file.}\\[2mm]  
    {\bf Rationale:} Different developers may have varying preferences for visual indicators (e.g., colors, underlines, icons) to improve readability and accommodate accessibility needs.\\  
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system provides user-adjustable settings (e.g., via a preferences menu) to modify the visual representation of code smells, such as changing highlight colors, toggling line markers, or selecting icon-based annotations.\\  
    {\bf Priority:} Medium  

\item \emph{The system must allow for refactoring of specific smells.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers should have the flexibility to refactor only selected code smells rather than applying all refactorings at once.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users can click on a specific detected smell and choose to refactor only that issue.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system must allow users to configure specific smell detection parameters.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Different projects may have varying definitions of what constitutes a long lambda function or a long message chain, so customizable thresholds improve flexibility.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system provides a configuration interface where users can set thresholds for smell detection (e.g., defining the maximum acceptable length for a lambda function or the number of chained method calls before triggering a warning).\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium

\item \emph{The system should generate and allow users to access logs of system processes.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Logs provide transparency on system operations, helping users debug issues and track changes.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system generates logs detailing detected smells, applied refactorings, and system errors, accessible through an interface or log file.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium

\item \emph{The system must allow users to accept or reject suggested refactored changes and apply the corresponding action.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Developers should have control over the changes made to their code to ensure refactorings align with project requirements.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool provides an interface where users can review, accept, or reject suggested refactorings before they are applied.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system must allow users to toggle smell linting on and off within the IDE.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Users should be able to control whether code smell detection is actively running, especially to avoid distractions in certain workflows.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system provides a toggle button to turn smell linting on or off. When this is enabled, the tool automatically highlights smells in open files, and when disabled, all highlighting/indications are removed.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium

\item \emph{The system must allow users to remove the history of detected smells and other cached data.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Clearing stored data helps users maintain a clean workspace, manage storage, and reset the tool for a fresh start.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system provides an option to delete previously detected smells and cached data, ensuring a reset state when needed.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium

    between energy efficiency and code readability. While refactoring
    may improve energy consumption metrics, it could inadvertently
    make the codebase less maintainable and more difficult to expand
    in the long term.
  \item The same can be said when it comes to performance. More
    energy efficient code might actually end up being less efficient
    when it comes to time and space complexity.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pylint:} A widely used static code analysis tool that
    detects various code smells in Python. It can be integrated into
    the refactoring tool to help identify inefficiencies in the code.
  \item \textbf{Flake8:} Linter that combines checks for style guide
    enforcement and code quality. Flake8 can assist in maintaining
    code standards while the tool focuses on energy efficiency.
  \item \textbf{PyJoule:} A tool for measuring the energy consumption
    of Python code. This product can provide essential data to
    evaluate the impact of refactorings on energy usage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reusable Components}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rope:} A library for Python that provides automated
    refactoring capabilities, helping streamline the process of
    improving code quality.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{SonarQube:} An open-source platform designed for
    continuous inspection of code quality. It helps developers manage
    code quality and security by analyzing source code to identify
    potential issues. Its architecture and methods for detecting code
    smells could be adapted to focus specifically on energy efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The introduction of the energy efficiency refactoring tool may lead
to several changes in the current development environment. These
effects include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool temporarily increases CPU and memory usage while
    running. The tool aims to optimize energy efficiency in code
    however it takes energy to run - in large codebases this could be
    significant energy and impact the performance of other
    applications running concurrently.
  \item The tool may have its own dependencies that now need to be
    included in the app or installed into the current system. Think
    Pysmells, Pyjoule etc.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Existing systems may need to be evaluated for compatibility
    with the new tool. Older versions of Python or other needed
    dependencies may not support the tool.
  \item The refactoring process could lead to variations in the
    performance of existing applications
  \item As the tool updates existing code, thorough testing will be
    needed to ensure everything still works correctly. This may
    require more effort from QA teams and additional time and
    resources to check the updated code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users may face difficulties in understanding how to
    effectively utilize the tool, particularly if they are not
    familiar with concepts like code smells and refactoring
    techniques. This learning curve may lead to initial frustration
    or reduced productivity.
  \item Some users may be resistant to adopting new tools or
    processes, particularly if they perceive the existing workflows
    as sufficient. This resistance could hinder the tool's successful
    implementation and limit its overall effectiveness.
  \item Users may misinterpret the output reports generated by the
    tool, such as energy savings or performance metrics. If users do
    not fully understand how to interpret these results, it could
    lead to incorrect conclusions about the tool's impact on their code.
  \item There is a risk that users might become overly reliant on the
    tool for refactoring without fully understanding the underlying
    principles. This could result in poor coding practices if users
    do not engage in thoughtful analysis of the suggested changes.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Limited Computational Resources:} Environments with
    restricted computational power may face challenges when running
    the tool, especially for large codebases. Limited resources could
    result in longer processing times or failures during analysis and
    refactoring.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Ongoing Maintenance:} The tool will need regular
    updates to stay compatible with new programming languages or
    standards, adding to the workload.
  \item \textbf{Performance Trade-offs:} Users may find that while
    some refactorings improve energy efficiency, they could
    negatively impact other performance metrics, such as execution speed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
The migration to the new tool will involve minimal disruption to
existing workflows, as the product is designed to integrate
seamlessly with Visual Studio Code. Developers will be able to
continue using their current workflows, with the addition of the
refactoring tool as a library that can be installed directly via
Python's package manager (pip) and an IDE plugin for an enhanced
development experience. The minimal installation and integration
requirements ensure ease of adoption for developers without needing
to overhaul existing infrastructure or processes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Installation Phase:}
    Developers can install the refactoring library directly using pip:
    \verb|pip install ecooptimizer|
    The IDE plugin can be installed by users through the Visual
    Studio Code Extensions marketplace.
  \item \textbf{Parallel Running:}
    There is no need for a phased implementation or parallel running
    of old and new systems. The tool can be directly integrated
    without affecting existing code or infrastructure.
  \item \textbf{Manual Backups:}
    Since the tool does not alter data without the user approval, no manual backups are required 
    before installation.
  \item \textbf{Phased Rollout:}
    If required, developers can start using the IDE plugin first, followed by the packaged version
    of the tool which will be installed using pip.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
Not Applicable

\section{Costs}
The total cost of developing this project is primarily based on the
effort involved by the development team, given that the tools and
platforms used (GitHub, open-source libraries) are free. The project
must be completed within the academic year (MVP ready by February
2025), which warrants smart planning and efficient resource allocation.

\subsection{Metrics for Estimation}
To estimate the total cost in terms of time and effort, the following
key metrics have been considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of input/output flows for the system.
  \item Number of business events.
  \item Number of product use cases.
  \item Number of functional and non-functional requirements.
  \item Number of constraint requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimation Approach}
Each deliverable has been assessed to estimate the time it will take
to implement based on the development environment. Early cost
estimates are based on general knowledge of the system and refined as
the team gradually gets a better understanding of the scope.

\subsection{Cost Breakdown}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Development Effort:} Based on the team size and
    project timeline, following time allocation is estimated:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Initial Research \& Setup: 50 hours per team member.
      \item Core development (e.g., refactoring tool, plugin): 300
        hours per team member.
      \item Testing and debugging: 80 hours per team member.
      \item Documentation \& finalization: 100 hours per team member.
      \item \textbf{Total estimated effort:} 530 hours per team member.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Tools and Software:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Open-source libraries: No associated costs.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Testing Environment:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The testing of the refactoring tool and energy
        consumption measurements is planned to be carried out using
        free tools on open source projects, with no additional cost expected.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimated Cost}
The above discussion indicates that the total effort will be
approximately 2650 team hours spread across the project phases. These
estimates could be refined using more detailed information as the
project progresses.
\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{User Manual}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Purpose:} Provide comprehensive guidance on how
        to use the refactoring plugin in VSCode
      \item \textbf{Target Audience:} Software developers integrating
        the library into their projects
      \item \textbf{Content:} Installation instructions, API
        references, usage examples, and best practices
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
For end-users, formal training is not required. The tool is designed to be simple and intuitive, 
with the assumption that primary users with experience in Python and software development will 
have the necessary technical expertise to use the plugin tool effectively. The plugin tool 
operates through clear, well-documented interfaces and requires minimal setup, allowing users to 
quickly incorporate it into their workflow without additional training.\\

Furthermore, the tool will come with comprehensive user documentation that includes step-by-step 
instructions on how to set up, integrate, and use the library within their existing development 
processes. This documentation will provide examples of common use cases and a clear explanation of 
the features of the tool, ensuring that users can get started easily and efficiently.

\section{Waiting Room}

This section lists potential features and enhancements that are not
critical for the initial release of the system but may be considered
for future updates. These ideas represent additional functionalities
that could improve the tool’s performance, user experience, or
integration with other systems.

\begin{enumerate}[label=WTRM \arabic*., wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
  \item \emph{The IDE plugin must provide interactive tips and
    progress indicators to guide users during the refactoring process.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This helps prevent user confusion during the
    refactoring process and enhances the user experience by providing
    clear, real-time feedback.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Tips and progress indicators display
    automatically when users initiate a refactoring action in the
    VSCode interface.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The tool must provide automated error reporting with
    user consent.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Automated error reporting helps developers
    quickly identify and address issues, improving the tool's
    reliability and reducing downtime with an option to include
    additional comments for context.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users are prompted to send error reports
    when an issue occurs, \\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The tool must allow users to define custom refactoring
    rules or preferences within the plugin.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This would allow developers more flexibility and
    control, enabling them to apply refactorings that best suit their
    projects while maintaining energy efficiency.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users can create a configuration file that
    describes their refactoring preferences.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The tool should provide a dashboard that offers deeper
      insights into refactoring decisions, showing side-by-side
      comparisons of energy consumption before and after refactoring,
    along with performance metrics.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This would help users better understand the
    impact of refactoring on both energy consumption and performance.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Users are able to access energy metrics for
    all their projects on a centralized platform.\\
    {\bf Priority:} High
  \item \emph{The tool show provide a plugin that integrates with
      multiple popular IDEs and syncs information across them through a
    centralized database.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Supporting multiple IDEs allows developers to
    use the tool within their preferred coding environments,
    enhancing user experience and adoption.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} Integration guides are provided for each
    supported IDE, with successful installation and functionality
    confirmed through user testing.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Low
  \item \emph{The refactoring library must be able to provide energy
      efficient refactorings for a wide variety of program languages
    (e.g., Java, C/C++, C\#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.)}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} Users around the world code projects in
    multitudes of languages depending on the context of their work.
    Being able to refactor in most popular languages would allow for
    the widespread usage of the tool.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The tool accepts and tailors code from the
    detected/specified language.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Low
  \item \emph{A reinforcement learning model must be developed to
      learn from the most energy-efficient refactorings and user
    preferences over time.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} The model must evolve to improve its refactoring
    suggestions by identifying patterns in energy-efficient code
    transformations and user preferences. By adapting its
    recommendations, the system will refine its ability to balance
    energy savings with maintainability and user preferences.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The reinforcement learning model is trained
    using gathered refactoring data and energy consumption
    measurement. Over multiple iterations, the model should improve
    its ability to predict refactorings that maximize energy
    efficiency while aligning with user choices.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
  \item \emph{The reinforcement learning model for the tool should
    accept human feedback in the reinforcement learning process.}\\[2mm]
    {\bf Rationale:} This will allow users to guide the system's
    refactoring decisions based on developer expertise and
    preferences. Moreover, it will balance automated refactoring with
    human oversight to ensure that complex refactoring decisions
    align with the project's goals and constraints.\\
    {\bf Fit Criterion:} The language model accepts human feedback
    and incorporates it into its future decisions.\\
    {\bf Priority:} Medium
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
In this section, we capture various ideas for implementing the
project requirements. These ideas provide technical approaches and
methods for achieving the energy-efficient refactoring of Python code
through the refactoring tool and IDE integration. By capturing these
ideas now, we ensure that potential technical approaches are not lost
and can be referred to during the design and development phase.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Refactoring Library Implementation via AST Parsing:}
    Use Python’s built-in \texttt{ast} (Abstract Syntax Tree) module
    to analyze code structure. The refactoring library can traverse
    the AST to detect inefficiencies and apply refactorings without
    modifying code functionality.
  \item \textbf{IDE Plugin for Refactoring – Leveraging VS Code API:}
    Build an extension for Visual Studio Code that hooks into the
    editor’s event system to provide real-time refactoring suggestions.
\end{itemize}

2. \textit{(\textbf{Individual}) Of the identified approaches, which
will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}

\subsubsection*{Ayushi Amin Reflection}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[label={}, wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]

  \item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how
    to incorporate it into our project.}

    I would choose looking through open-source Python projects that
    use reinforcement learning tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow. It
    lets me see real-world applications, understand how others are
    using reinforcement learning, and gives me concrete examples to
    work with, which helps me learn more effectively through hands-on
    experience.

  \item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics
    and common code smells.}

    I would go with practical experience, contributing to open-source
    projects, where I can directly apply performance optimizations
    and get feedback through code reviews. Real-world application
    will help cement these concepts better.

  \item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated
      refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as
    Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.}

    I would go for hands-on implementation in my projects. I learn
    best by doing, so I would set up a project where I can integrate
    rope for refactoring and Pylint or Flake8 for linting. This would
    give me a chance to really see how these tools fit into the
    development process, and I could refine my setup as I work.

  \item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and
      compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like
    PyJoule for energy profiling.}

    I would prefer diving into the research around energy-efficient
    algorithms and then trying things out with PyJoule. I enjoy
    exploring new tools and methods, so experimenting with how
    different code changes affect energy use would be a good challenge for me.

  \item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS
    Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

    I like learning by creating, so I would build an extension right
    away. This way, I would get immediate experience with JavaScript
    and TypeScript while learning the VS Code extension framework.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Mya Hussain Reflection}
To advance my skills for the capstone project, I plan on deepening my
understanding of Python’s performance characteristics and common code
smells while leveraging my existing knowledge of Python. I plan to
read up on different potential code smells, detection methods and
possible refactoring remedies and immediately apply these insights to
help develop a proof of concept (POC) for our project. For mastering
refactoring tools like Rope and integrating linters such as Pylint
and Flake8, I will set up a local project environment to experiment
with these tools specifically for our POC. Additionally, I’ll explore
energy-efficient algorithms and use PyJoule to analyze how different
refactoring strategies impact performance in our specific context. To
enhance my proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript for developing VS
Code extensions, I plan on watching online tutorials and perhaps take
an online Javascript/Typescript course as it has been a while since I
have been familiar with the syntax. I will also watch tutorials on
how to set up a VSCode extension as this project will be my first
time doing it. I'm very excited to start coding up a POC and move on
from the documentation stage. With every requirement we write the
team feels more and more pressure to make sure our idea will work.
It's hard to write so much about a product that doesn't yet exist
without having the proof that it can exist. Or at least my mind is
having a hard time writing so much about what currently is an empty repository.

  \item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how
    to incorporate it into our project.}

    I plan to watch online courses on reinforcement learning. I
    prefer learning visually whenever possible. Since this is a
    fairly new concept for me, I think online courses would be the
    best, providing a mix of lectures and self-assignments. A lot of
    courses also provide access to an online learning community which
    is perfect for a beginner like me.

  \item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics
    and common code smells.}

    For this, I will contribute to open source Python projects. Live
    projects are a good way to expose to practical coding challenges
    related to performance and code smells. It will also allow me to
    learn from more experience contributors and spot common code
    smells so that I can write scalable and efficient Python code.

  \item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated
      refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as
    Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.}

    I will follow comprehensive tutorials to get experience in using
    Rope for automatic refactoring. Comprehension tutorials provide
    guided experience with Python tooling, helping to explore
    features of tools like Rope, Pylint, and Flake8 in-depth.  The
    tutorials are structured, therefore helping to quickly gain
    familiarity with functionality and usage in real-world scenarios.

  \item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and
      compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like
    PyJoule for energy profiling.}

    For this I will conduct research on energy-efficient algorithms
    and their application in Python refactoring. This will give me
    the option to follow a hands-on approach which allows for
    comparing different strategies and asses their energy consumption
    in multiple scenarios.

  \item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS
    Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

    For this I will practise building simple VS Code extensions using
    JavaScript or TypeScript through YouTube tutorials. It can help
    me gain hands-on experience with the languages in a real-world
    context. These practical exercises can be used to not only
    solidfiy my understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript but also
    familiarize me with how these languages are used to create
    functional VS Code extensions, enhancing both my coding skills
    and extension development proficiency.

  \item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how
    to incorporate it into our project.}

    For this topic, I plan on watching online courses and tutorials
    since it's a subject I have basically no experience in. Watching
    videos is the better option for me in this case since having
    someone explain the knowledge and providing examples will allow
    me to grasp the material faster.

  \item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics
    and common code smells.}

    I believe reading articles and going through documentation will
    be best for me for this topic. I already have a good base in
    programming and Python specifically so written documents will
    allow me to digest the new information at my own pace.

  \item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated
      refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as
    Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.}

    When it comes to libraries and modules, I tend to fare well by
    just reading the documentation and looking over code examples
    using those tools.

  \item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and
      compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like
    PyJoule for energy profiling.}

    For this topic, experimentation will be my best option as it is
    not really a matter of learning something completely new but
    applying a new tool in a known environment.

  \item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS
    Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

    I already have some experience working with those languages, so I
    will only need to refer to the documentation for the occasional
    refresher on syntax and such.

\begin{itemize}[label={}, wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]

  \item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how
    to incorporate it into our project.}

    I prefer to look through open source Python projects that use
    reinforcement learning tools to get used to it. While
    documentation and tutorials are readily available online whenever
    I need to reference them, I’m interested in seeing how tools such
    as PyTorch are applied in a live project so that I can get a
    clear understanding of their use. If possible, I will also
    contribute to these open source projects to implement these tools
    in a side project before doing for the capstone. This way I can
    be ready to implement in our project.

  \item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics
    and common code smells.}

    I will enrol in online courses since they include structured
    learning for these tools to optimize Python code. These courses
    also include hands on exercises that I can practice solidifying
    my skills for identifying performance bottlenecks and avoiding code smells.

  \item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated
      refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as
    Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.}

    I plan to follow comprehensive tutorials as these can break down
    complex topics into manageable subtopics, therefore helping in
    gradually building experience in these libraries. I can follow
    them at my own pace, so I have time to both experiment and
    troubleshoot. This way I can fully grasp the process of
    integrating these into Python projects.

  \item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and
      compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like
    PyJoule for energy profiling.}

    I plan to conduct research on analyzing the energy impact on
    various code structures using PyJoules. This way I can gather
    data to make informed refactoring decisions. This also opens up
    the opportunity to develop more efficient algorithms that can
    optimize performance and energy usage in Python applications.

  \item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS
    Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

    Taking online courses tailored to JavaScript or TypeScript for
    extension development would give me a deeper understanding of how
    these languages are used in developing VS Code extensions. These
    focused courses include key concepts and best practices, helping
    me quickly become comfortable  in the exact skills needed for
    extension development.
