\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, an essential component of the global economy, is responsible for 2-4\% of global CO2 emissions today, with projections suggesting this could rise to 14\% by 2040 ~\citep{BelkhirAndElmeligi2018}. To meet sustainability goals, including a 72\% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}, this sector must find ways to improve energy efficiency.

One area of concern is the energy consumption of software systems. However, for software engineers, it is not practical for them to focus on optimizing energy consumption while developing complex programs. Instead, supporting tools and technologies are needed to assist in improving energy efficiency without altering the intended behaviour of the software.

This project aims to tackle Python, a popular but energy inefficient programming language. Python consumes significantly more energy compared to more efficient languages like C and Rustâ€”over 70 times more energy, on average, for similar tasks ~\citep{PereiraEtAl2017}. The project's goal is to develop tools to reduce Python's energy consumption through automated refactoring. While this will not solve the entire problem of the carbon footprint associated with the software, it is a step towards more energy-efficient practices in the software development process.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\noindent \textbf{Purpose}: The purpose of this project is to provide software engineers with tools to optimize the energy efficiency of Python programs by automating refactoring suggestions, while still allowing users to review and decide whether to apply the changes.

\noindent \textbf{Advantage}: By reducing the energy consumption of Python programs, this project will contribute to the broader effort of decreasing the carbon footprint of software development, supporting the ICT sector's goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 72\% by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}.

\noindent \textbf{Measurement}: The project's success can be measured by the reduction in energy usage 
achieved after applying the refactorings. Benchmarks will compare the energy consumption of original 
and refactored code, to achieve a measurable percentage reduction in energy consumption. The user's 
ability to make informed choices about whether to apply refactorings will also be evaluated through 
user feedback.

It is assumed for this system that users will be seeking to refactor Python code and will make use of Visual Studio Code.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

  The current software development landscape often prioritizes functionality and performance over energy efficiency. Many existing Python codebases are not optimized for energy consumption, leading to unnecessary power usage and increased carbon footprint. The following aspects characterize the current situation:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Manual Refactoring:} Developers typically perform refactoring manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
    \item \textbf{Limited Awareness:} Many developers lack awareness of energy-efficient coding practices and their impact on overall energy consumption.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Automated Tools:} There is a lack of widely adopted automated tools specifically designed to refactor Python code for energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Performance-Centric Optimization:} Most existing optimization tools focus on performance improvements rather than energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Code Patterns:} Many codebases contain inefficient code patterns that consume more energy than necessary.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textcolor{red}{The project aims to address these issues by:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated Refactoring Library:} Developing a Python library that automatically detects and refactors code for improved energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{IDE Integration:} Creating a Visual Studio Code plugin that integrates the refactoring library, providing real-time suggestions and automated refactoring options.
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption Measurement:} Implementing tools to measure and compare energy consumption before and after refactoring.
    \item \textbf{Developer Education:} Raising awareness about energy-efficient coding practices through the tool's suggestions and documentation.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:} Implementing a reinforcement learning model to improve refactoring suggestions over time based on developer feedback and real-world energy savings data.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Open Issues}

This section outlines unresolved questions and challenges that may impact the development, functionality, or integration of the system. These issues require further research, discussion, or testing to ensure successful project completion.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Further research is needed to determine the optimal balance between energy efficiency and code readability. While refactoring may improve energy consumption metrics, it could inadvertently make the codebase less maintainable and more difficult to expand in the long term.
  \item The same can be said when it comes to performance. More energy efficient code might actually end up being less efficient when it comes to time and space complexity.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pylint:} A widely used static code analysis tool that detects various code smells in Python. It can be integrated into the refactoring tool to help identify inefficiencies in the code.
  \item \textbf{Flake8:} Linter that combines checks for style guide enforcement and code quality. Flake8 can assist in maintaining code standards while the tool focuses on energy efficiency.
  \item \textbf{PyJoule:} A tool for measuring the energy consumption of Python code. This product can provide essential data to evaluate the impact of refactorings on energy usage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reusable Components}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rope:} A library for Python that provides automated refactoring capabilities, helping streamline the process of improving code quality.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{SonarQube:} An open-source platform designed for continuous inspection of code quality. It helps developers manage code quality and security by analyzing source code to identify potential issues. Its architecture and methods for detecting code smells could be adapted to focus specifically on energy efficiency. 
\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The introduction of the energy efficiency refactoring tool may lead to several changes in the current development environment. These effects include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool temporarily increases CPU and memory usage while running. The tool aims to optimize energy efficiency in code however it takes energy to run - in large codebases this could be significant energy and impact the performance of other applications running concurrently. 
  \item The tool may have its own dependencies that now need to be included in the app or installed into the current system. Think Pysmells, Pyjoule etc.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Existing systems may need to be evaluated for compatibility with the new tool. Older versions of Python or other needed dependencies may not support the tool.
  \item The refactoring process could lead to variations in the performance of existing applications
  \item As the tool updates existing code, thorough testing will be needed to ensure everything still works correctly. This may require more effort from QA teams and additional time and resources to check the updated code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users may face difficulties in understanding how to effectively utilize the tool, particularly if they are not familiar with concepts like code smells and refactoring techniques. This learning curve may lead to initial frustration or reduced productivity.
  \item Some users may be resistant to adopting new tools or processes, particularly if they perceive the existing workflows as sufficient. This resistance could hinder the tool's successful implementation and limit its overall effectiveness.
  \item Users may misinterpret the output reports generated by the tool, such as energy savings or performance metrics. If users do not fully understand how to interpret these results, it could lead to incorrect conclusions about the tool's impact on their code.
  \item There is a risk that users might become overly reliant on the tool for refactoring without fully understanding the underlying principles. This could result in poor coding practices if users do not engage in thoughtful analysis of the suggested changes.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Limited Computational Resources:} Environments with restricted computational power may face challenges when running the tool, especially for large codebases. Limited resources could result in longer processing times or failures during analysis and refactoring.
  \item \textbf{Lack of Test Coverage:} If existing codebases lack comprehensive test suites, validating the functionality of refactored code may become challenging. Without adequate tests, it will be difficult to ensure that the tool's changes do not introduce new issues.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Ongoing Maintenance:} The tool will need regular updates to stay compatible with new programming languages or standards, adding to the workload.
  \item \textbf{Performance Trade-offs:} Users may find that while some refactorings improve energy efficiency, they could negatively impact other performance metrics, such as execution speed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
The migration to the new tool will involve minimal disruption to existing workflows, as the product is designed to integrate seamlessly with GitHub Actions and Visual Studio Code. Developers will be able to continue using their current workflows, with the addition of the refactoring tool as a library that can be installed directly via Python's package manager (pip), an IDE plugin for an enhanced development experience, and a GitHub Action for automated refactoring in their CI/CD pipelines. The minimal installation and integration requirements ensure ease of adoption for developers without needing to overhaul existing infrastructure or processes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Installation Phase:} 
    Developers can install the refactoring library directly using pip:
    \verb|pip install ecooptimizer|
    The IDE plugin can be installed by users through the Visual Studio Code marketplace. The GitHub Action can be integrated by adding the appropriate YAML configuration to the repository's workflow files.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Running:} 
    There is no need for a phased implementation or parallel running of old and new systems. The tool can be directly integrated without affecting existing code or infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Manual Backups:} 
    Since the tool does not alter data but rather provides refactoring suggestions, no manual backups are required before installation.
    \item \textbf{Phased Rollout:} 
    If required, developers can start using the refactoring library first, followed by the IDE plugin, and then integrate the GitHub Action to automate refactoring in their CI/CD workflows.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
In this section, we capture various ideas for implementing the project requirements. These ideas provide technical approaches and methods for achieving the energy-efficient refactoring of Python code through the refactoring tool, IDE integration, and CI/CD automation. By capturing these ideas now, we ensure that potential technical approaches are not lost and can be referred to during the design and development phase.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Refactoring Library Implementation via AST Parsing:}

\begin{itemize}[label={}, wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]

  \item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how to incorporate it into our project.}
  
  I would choose looking through open-source Python projects that use reinforcement learning tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow. It lets me see real-world applications, understand how others are using reinforcement learning, and gives me concrete examples to work with, which helps me learn more effectively through hands-on experience.
      
  \item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics and common code smells.}
  
  I would go with practical experience, contributing to open-source projects, where I can directly apply performance optimizations and get feedback through code reviews. Real-world application will help cement these concepts better.
      
  \item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.} 
  
  I would go for hands-on implementation in my projects. I learn best by doing, so I would set up a project where I can integrate rope for refactoring and Pylint or Flake8 for linting. This would give me a chance to really see how these tools fit into the development process, and I could refine my setup as I work.
      
  \item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like PyJoule for energy profiling.}
  
  I would prefer diving into the research around energy-efficient algorithms and then trying things out with PyJoule. I enjoy exploring new tools and methods, so experimenting with how different code changes affect energy use would be a good challenge for me.

  \item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

  I like learning by creating, so I would build an extension right away. This way, I would get immediate experience with JavaScript and TypeScript while learning the VS Code extension framework.

\end{itemize}

 \subsubsection*{Mya Hussain Reflection}
 To advance my skills for the capstone project, I plan on deepening my understanding of Pythonâ€™s performance characteristics and common code smells while leveraging my existing knowledge of Python. I plan to read up on different potential code smells, detection methods and possible refactoring remedies and immediately apply these insights to help develop a proof of concept (POC) for our project.Â For mastering refactoring tools like Rope and integrating linters such as Pylint and Flake8, I will set up a local project environment to experiment with these tools specifically for our POC. Additionally, Iâ€™ll explore energy-efficient algorithms and use PyJoule to analyze how different refactoring strategies impact performance in our specific context. To enhance my proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript for developing VS Code extensions,Â I plan on watching online tutorials and perhaps take an online Javascript/Typescript course as it has been a while since I have been familiar with the syntax. I will also watch tutorials on how to set up a VSCode extension as this project will be my first time doing it. I'm very excited to start coding up a POC and move on from the documentation stage. With every requirement we write the team feels more and more pressure to make sure our idea will work. It's hard to write so much about a product that doesn't yet exist without having the proof that it can exist. Or at least my mind is having a hard time writing so much about what currently is an empty repository.

\item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how to incorporate it into our project.}

I plan to watch online courses on reinforcement learning. I prefer learning visually whenever possible. Since this is a fairly new concept for me, I think online courses would be the best, providing a mix of lectures and self-assignments. A lot of courses also provide access to an online learning community which is perfect for a beginner like me.


\item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics and common code smells.}

For this, I will contribute to open source Python projects. Live projects are a good way to expose to practical coding challenges related to performance and code smells. It will also allow me to learn from more experience contributors and spot common code smells so that I can write scalable and efficient Python code.

\item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.} 

I will follow comprehensive tutorials to get experience in using Rope for automatic refactoring. Comprehension tutorials provide guided experience with Python tooling, helping to explore features of tools like Rope, Pylint, and Flake8 in-depth.  The tutorials are structured, therefore helping to quickly gain familiarity with functionality and usage in real-world scenarios.

\item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like PyJoule for energy profiling.}

For this I will conduct research on energy-efficient algorithms and their application in Python refactoring. This will give me the option to follow a hands-on approach which allows for comparing different strategies and asses their energy consumption in multiple scenarios.

\item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

For this I will practise building simple VS Code extensions using JavaScript or TypeScript through YouTube tutorials.

\begin{itemize}[label={}, wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]

  \item \textit{Learn how reinforcement learning works as well as how to incorporate it into our project.}
  
  For this topic, I plan on watching online courses and tutorials since it's a subject I have basically no experience in. Watching videos is the better option for me in this case since having someone explain the knowledge and providing examples will allow me to grasp the material faster.
      
  \item \textit{Understanding of Python's performance characteristics and common code smells.}
  
  I believe reading articles and going through documentation will be best for me for this topic. I already have a good base in programming and Python specifically so written documents will allow me to digest the new information at my own pace.
      
  \item \textit{Experience in using libraries like rope for automated refactoring and familiarity with integrating linters such as Pylint or Flake8 into the development workflow.} 
  
  When it comes to libraries and modules, I tend to fare well by just reading the documentation and looking over code examples using those tools.
      
  \item \textit{Ability to develop algorithms that analyze and compare different refactoring strategies, using tools like PyJoule for energy profiling.}
  
  For this topic, experimentation will be my best option as it is not really a matter of learning something completely new but applying a new tool in a known environment. 

  \item \textit{Proficiency in JavaScript or TypeScript, as most VS Code extensions are developed using these languages.}

  I already have some experience working with those languages, so I will only need to refer to the documentation for the occasional refresher on syntax and such.
